# Stock_Analysis
#VBA Challenge

##Overview of Project 
In this analysis it will include an excel sheet that contains two buttons. One of the buttons will generate information on the ticker, total daily volume, and return for year 2017 and 2018. It will also provide the timer on how fast the script ran for. The second button clears out the information in order to obtain year 2017 or year 2018 information. 

###Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to expand our research further to help Steve provide his parents with information on which stocks, out of thousands, were better to invest in. In this analysis it will show a refactored Excel VBA code to obtain stock information from year 2017 and year 2018 as well as the script run time. Overall, we refactored the code to determine if the script ran faster. 

##Results
###Analysis 
In the image below you will see comments with one single quotation that describes what the code is or what is happening to understand the code process in order to generate the output in the excel sheet. 

As you can see in 2017 majority of the stocks performed better than year 2018. You can determine the success of each stock by looking at the return column. The green colored box or cell indicate a positive return where the red colored box indicated a negative return. In you run the analysis for 2017 the script ran for 0.609375 which was a tab bit slower in the original code. If you run the script for 2018 it ran for 0.6171875 which ran faster with the refactored code. 

###Summary 
The advantages of refactoring the code it allows for the code to be more concise; it decrease the macro run time and it provides information to help a person or Steve understand the process of performing the analysis on thousands of stocks.  The disadvantage of refactoring the code is that it can lead to errors or that the code is so long that we are unable to refactor it.
